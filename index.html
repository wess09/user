            <p>            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
            <p>            Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/></p>
            <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</p>
            <p>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>                 Preamble</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</p>
            <p>software and other kinds of works.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</p>
            <p>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,</p>
            <p>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</p>
            <p>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</p>
            <p>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</p>
            <p>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</p>
            <p>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to</p>
            <p>your programs, too.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p>
            <p>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p>
            <p>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p>
            <p>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</p>
            <p>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</p>
            <p>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</p>
            <p>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have</p>
            <p>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</p>
            <p>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p>
            <p>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</p>
            <p>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive</p>
            <p>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they</p>
            <p>know their rights.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p>
            <p>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</p>
            <p>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains</p>
            <p>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and</p>
            <p>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</p>
            <p>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</p>
            <p>authors of previous versions.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</p>
            <p>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</p>
            <p>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</p>
            <p>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic</p>
            <p>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</p>
            <p>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we</p>
            <p>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</p>
            <p>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</p>
            <p>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</p>
            <p>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</p>
            <p>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</p>
            <p>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</p>
            <p>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</p>
            <p>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that</p>
            <p>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p>
            <p>modification follow.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>            TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>0. Definitions.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</p>
            <p>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</p>
            <p>License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and</p>
            <p>"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</p>
            <p>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</p>
            <p>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the</p>
            <p>earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based</p>
            <p>on the Program.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without</p>
            <p>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</p>
            <p>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</p>
            <p>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,</p>
            <p>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</p>
            <p>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</p>
            <p>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through</p>
            <p>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"</p>
            <p>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</p>
            <p>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</p>
            <p>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</p>
            <p>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</p>
            <p>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If</p>
            <p>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</p>
            <p>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>1. Source Code.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work</p>
            <p>for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source</p>
            <p>form of a work.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official</p>
            <p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p>
            <p>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p>
            <p>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other</p>
            <p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p>
            <p>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p>
            <p>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p>
            <p>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p>
            <p>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A</p>
            <p>"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component</p>
            <p>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p>
            <p>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p>
            <p>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all</p>
            <p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p>
            <p>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p>
            <p>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's</p>
            <p>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p>
            <p>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p>
            <p>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source</p>
            <p>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p>
            <p>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p>
            <p>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p>
            <p>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p>
            <p>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p>
            <p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p>
            <p>Source.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p>
            <p>same work.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>2. Basic Permissions.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p>
            <p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p>
            <p>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p>
            <p>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a</p>
            <p>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p>
            <p>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your</p>
            <p>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p>
            <p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p>
            <p>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p>
            <p>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p>
            <p>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p>
            <p>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p>
            <p>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works</p>
            <p>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p>
            <p>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p>
            <p>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p>
            <p>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p>
            <p>makes it unnecessary.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p>
            <p>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p>
            <p>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p>
            <p>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p>
            <p>measures.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p>
            <p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p>
            <p>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p>
            <p>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p>
            <p>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's</p>
            <p>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p>
            <p>technological measures.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you</p>
            <p>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p>
            <p>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p>
            <p>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p>
            <p>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p>
            <p>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p>
            <p>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p>
            <p>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p>
            <p>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p>
            <p>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p>
            <p>it, and giving a relevant date.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p>
            <p>released under this License and any conditions added under section</p>
            <p>7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p>
            <p>"keep intact all notices".</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p>
            <p>License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This</p>
            <p>License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p>
            <p>additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p>
            <p>regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no</p>
            <p>permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p>
            <p>invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p>
            <p>Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p>
            <p>interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p>
            <p>work need not make them do so.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p>
            <p>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p>
            <p>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p>
            <p>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p>
            <p>"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p>
            <p>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users</p>
            <p>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work</p>
            <p>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p>
            <p>parts of the aggregate.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p>
            <p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p>
            <p>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p>
            <p>in one of these ways:</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
            <p>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p>
            <p>customarily used for software interchange.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
            <p>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p>
            <p>written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p>
            <p>long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p>
            <p>model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p>
            <p>copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p>
            <p>product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p>
            <p>medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p>
            <p>more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p>
            <p>conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p>
            <p>written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This</p>
            <p>alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p>
            <p>only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p>
            <p>with subsection 6b.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p>
            <p>place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p>
            <p>further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to</p>
            <p>copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p>
            <p>may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p>
            <p>that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p>
            <p>clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p>
            <p>available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p>
            <p>you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p>
            <p>Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p>
            <p>charge under subsection 6d.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p>
            <p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p>
            <p>included in conveying the object code work.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any</p>
            <p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p>
            <p>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p>
            <p>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p>
            <p>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular</p>
            <p>product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a</p>
            <p>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p>
            <p>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p>
            <p>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product</p>
            <p>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p>
            <p>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p>
            <p>the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,</p>
            <p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p>
            <p>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p>
            <p>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must</p>
            <p>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p>
            <p>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p>
            <p>modification has been made.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p>
            <p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p>
            <p>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p>
            <p>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p>
            <p>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p>
            <p>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply</p>
            <p>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p>
            <p>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p>
            <p>been installed in ROM).</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p>
            <p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p>
            <p>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p>
            <p>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a</p>
            <p>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p>
            <p>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p>
            <p>protocols for communication across the network.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p>
            <p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p>
            <p>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p>
            <p>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</p>
            <p>unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>7. Additional Terms.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this</p>
            <p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p>
            <p>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p>
            <p>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p>
            <p>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions</p>
            <p>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p>
            <p>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p>
            <p>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p>
            <p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p>
            <p>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p>
            <p>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place</p>
            <p>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</p>
            <p>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</p>
            <p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</p>
            <p>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p>
            <p>terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p>
            <p>author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</p>
            <p>Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</p>
            <p>requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</p>
            <p>reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</p>
            <p>authors of the material; or</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</p>
            <p>trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p>
            <p>material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p>
            <p>it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p>
            <p>any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p>
            <p>those licensors and authors.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further</p>
            <p>restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you</p>
            <p>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p>
            <p>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p>
            <p>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains</p>
            <p>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p>
            <p>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p>
            <p>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p>
            <p>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p>
            <p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p>
            <p>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p>
            <p>where to find the applicable terms.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p>
            <p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p>
            <p>the above requirements apply either way.</p>
     <p></p>
            <p>8. Termination.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p>
            <p>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p>
            <p>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p>
            <p>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p>
            <p>paragraph of section 11).</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p>
            <p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p>
            <p>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p>
            <p>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p>
            <p>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p>
            <p>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p>
            <p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p>
            <p>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p>
            <p>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p>
            <p>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p>
            <p>your receipt of the notice.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p>
            <p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p>
            <p>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p>
            <p>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p>
            <p>material under section 10.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p>
            <p>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p>
            <p>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p>
            <p>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,</p>
            <p>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p>
            <p>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do</p>
            <p>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p>
            <p>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p>
            <p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p>
            <p>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible</p>
            <p>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
     <p></p></p>
            <p>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an</p>
            <p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p>
            <p>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered</p>
            <p>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p>
            <p>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p>
            <p>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could</p>
            <p>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p>
            <p>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p>
            <p>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p>
            <p></p>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may</p>
            <p></p>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p>
            <p></p>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p>
            <p></p>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p>
            <p></p>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p>
            <p></p>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>11. Patents.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p>
            <p></p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The</p>
            <p></p>work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims</p>
            <p></p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p>
            <p></p>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p>
            <p></p>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p>
            <p></p>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p>
            <p></p>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For</p>
            <p></p>purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant</p>
            <p></p>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p>
            <p></p>this License.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p>
            <p></p>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to</p>
            <p></p>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p>
            <p></p>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express</p>
            <p></p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p>
            <p></p>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p>
            <p></p>sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a</p>
            <p></p>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p>
            <p></p>patent against the party.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p>
            <p></p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p>
            <p></p>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p>
            <p></p>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p>
            <p></p>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p>
            <p></p>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p>
            <p></p>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p>
            <p></p>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p>
            <p></p>license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have</p>
            <p></p>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p>
            <p></p>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work</p>
            <p></p>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p>
            <p></p>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p>
            <p></p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p>
            <p></p>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p>
            <p></p>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p>
            <p></p>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p>
            <p></p>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p>
            <p></p>work and works based on it.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within</p>
            <p></p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p>
            <p></p>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p>
            <p></p>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered</p>
            <p></p>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p>
            <p></p>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p>
            <p></p>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p>
            <p></p>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p>
            <p></p>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p>
            <p></p>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p>
            <p></p>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p>
            <p></p>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p>
            <p></p>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p>
            <p></p>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p>
            <p></p>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p>
            <p></p>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p>
            <p></p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p>
            <p></p>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a</p>
            <p></p>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p>
            <p></p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p>
            <p></p>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p>
            <p></p>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p>
            <p></p>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p>
            <p></p>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p>
            <p></p>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p>
            <p></p>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p>
            <p></p>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this</p>
            <p></p>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p>
            <p></p>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p>
            <p></p>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p>
            <p></p>combination as such.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p>
            <p></p>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</p>
            <p></p>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p>
            <p></p>address new problems or concerns.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the</p>
            <p></p>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</p>
            <p></p>Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the</p>
            <p></p>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p>
            <p></p>version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p>
            <p></p>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p>
            <p></p>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p>
            <p></p>by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p>
            <p></p>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's</p>
            <p></p>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p>
            <p></p>to choose that version for the Program.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Later license versions may give you additional or different</p>
            <p></p>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p>
            <p></p>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</p>
            <p></p>later version.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p>
            <p></p>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</p>
            <p></p>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY</p>
            <p></p>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</p>
            <p></p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p>
            <p></p>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</p>
            <p></p>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</p>
            <p></p>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>16. Limitation of Liability.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</p>
            <p></p>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</p>
            <p></p>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</p>
            <p></p>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</p>
            <p></p>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</p>
            <p></p>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</p>
            <p></p>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</p>
            <p></p>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p>
            <p></p>SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</p>
            <p></p>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</p>
            <p></p>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</p>
            <p></p>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</p>
            <p></p>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</p>
            <p></p>copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>          END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest</p>
            <p></p>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it</p>
            <p></p>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest</p>
            <p></p>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</p>
            <p></p>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least</p>
            <p></p>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
                    <p></p></p>
            <p></p><one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.></p>
            <p></p>Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author></p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify</p>
            <p></p>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by</p>
            <p></p>the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or</p>
            <p></p>(at your option) any later version.</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,</p>
            <p></p>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of</p>
            <p></p>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the</p>

            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License</p>
            <p></p>along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short</p>
            <p></p>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p><program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author></p>
            <p></p>This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.</p>
            <p></p>This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it</p>
            <p></p>under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate</p>
            <p></p>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands</p>
            <p></p>might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".</p>
            <p></p></p>
            <p></p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,</p>
            <p></p>if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.</p>
